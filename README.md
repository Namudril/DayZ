Here are some useful scripts to ease your everyday experience with DayZ

kill-dayz.bat
Someties game crashes with no access to Desktop. You simply make a shortcut to this file and then pin the shortcut to the Start menu.
Hit Win key and click kill-dayz.bat - that's it!

dayz-del-logs.bat
Quickly removes .LOG and .RPT from the DayZ local folder. Those files may reach Gigabytes in size ust in dayz (days, sorry).
You are not going to use this very often, so there's o need in pinning a shortcut to the Start menu. Just be sure, you know were this script is.
